# ✈️ FlightBot Simulation Project

This project showcases an intelligent flight simulation system designed to replicate real-life cockpit conditions using Python automation and cinematic video presentation. It combines coding, simulation, and storytelling to bring FlightBot — an AI-powered virtual co-pilot — to life.

## 🧠 About FlightBot

**FlightBot** is an AI-driven innovation that I am developing to transform cockpit decision-making and aviation safety. Designed to integrate seamlessly with key aircraft systems such as the Automated Voice Alert System, flight instruments, engine monitoring systems, and navigation controls, FlightBot is intended to provide pilots with real-time guidance during critical situations. It functions as an intelligent co-pilot, constantly monitoring aircraft performance, sensors, and mechanical systems to deliver immediate, actionable insights.

In the event of an emergency, FlightBot can be activated with a single press of a button. Within just two seconds, it runs a full diagnostic of all aircraft sensors and mechanical systems. Where a pilot might take five seconds to visually check instruments and reference manuals, FlightBot completes the assessment instantly and delivers guided instructions, enabling faster and more precise decision-making. 

For example, during an engine failure on takeoff, FlightBot identifies the affected system, outlines the necessary procedures, and communicates key steps while coordinating with Air Traffic Control and nearby airports.

To support its development, I have also created a **cockpit simulation prototype** programmed using **Java, Python, CSS, and HTML**. This simulation models emergency scenarios and demonstrates how FlightBot interacts with aircraft systems and pilots in real-time. It provides a safe, interactive platform to test and refine AI-assisted decision-making, showing how FlightBot could enhance safety, reduce response times, and improve crisis management in the cockpit.

**FlightBot represents the next frontier in aviation technology**, combining artificial intelligence, real-time diagnostics, and system integration to support pilots, optimize safety, and redefine what is possible in the skies.

## 🎬 Simulation Overview

The next window showcases a pre-recorded simulation of **FlightBot** in action.  
Due to hardware limitations, running the live Python environment in real time proved challenging, resulting in occasional lag and performance drops in the display window.

To ensure a seamless experience, this recording presents the complete demonstration.  
It captures a high-intensity cockpit sequence where an aircraft experiences **dual engine failure during final approach (landing)**.  
The simulation features synchronized subtitles, FlightBot’s activation sequence, authentic cockpit alarm sounds, and dynamic communication between the **Pilot**, **Co-Pilot**, **Cabin Crew**, and **Air Traffic Control** — demonstrating how composure, trust, and intelligent systems can safely guide an aircraft to the runway with or without ILS.

Immerse yourself in a true-to-life aviation emergency powered by FlightBot’s intelligent response system — a fusion of **code, realism, and human precision**.
